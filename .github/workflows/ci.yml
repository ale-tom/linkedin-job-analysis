# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that sets up a CI pipeline for a Python project.
# It runs on pushes and pull requests to the master branch.
# The workflow includes the following steps:
# 1. Checks out the repository.
# 2. Sets up Python 3.8.
# 3. Installs the required dependencies from requirements.txt.
# 4. Installs pytest.
# 5. Runs the tests using pytest with options to stop after the first failure and disable warnings.
# 6. Runs flake8 for linting with specific configurations:
#    - Sets the maximum line length to 120 characters.
#    - Sets the maximum complexity to 10.
#    - Excludes certain directories from linting (e.g., .git, venv, build, dist).
# 7. The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the master branch.
